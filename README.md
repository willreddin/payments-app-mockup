# payments-app-mockup

I wanted to test a couple of payment options. So I hooked up a simple page to [Go Cardless](https://
gocardless.com/) and [stripe](https://stripe.com/gb)

For stripe there's also a webhook that sends events to [keen](keen.io), at the moment it collects events around customer creation and successful charges
